TTC Mobility Potentials and Equity:
Quantifying the Change in Travel Potential and Transit Reliability over Time & Space

This project investigates whether changes in public transit accessibility across Toronto census tracts (2015-2025) are equitably distributed or associated with socioeconomic factors like income, homeownership, and minority status. Using spatial statistics and geospatial analysis, we identify patterns of transit improvement/decline and examine potential equity implications.

The intermediate outputs and final visual deliverables of the project can be found in the folder **figures**. The code for unsuccessful reliability data can be explored **INSERT NAME**.
